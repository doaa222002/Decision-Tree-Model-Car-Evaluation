# Decision-Tree-Model-Car-Evaluation
This project uses a Decision Tree model to classify cars based on features like buying price, maintenance, doors, person capacity, luggage boot size, and safety. The model categorizes cars into acceptable, good, or very good, providing an interpretable, rule-based classification method.
